\begin{description}
  \item[Consumption] : indicate where energy is being consumed and by whom, as
    well as extract statistics, which can be linked to other factors, like for
    instance thermostat settings, outdoor temperature, activity in the
    home\ldots
  \item[React] to the environment : turn lights and other appliances on and off
    depending on activity and time of day. It would be interesting for example
    to turn off lights when no human presence is detected, to use power-hungry
    devices during the night to even out power usage, or to adjust the lighting
    to suit the amount of natural light coming in a room. 
\end{description}

The benefits of such a system are twofold : first, it has been
demonstrated\cite{darby2006} that simply providing people with data about their
energy consumption results in a substantial drop in power usage. It can also
help to make statistics and comparisons between devices and households.

\section{Conclusion}


The hardware design is functional, and can be demonstrated as requested.
However, not everything is fully functional, and many areas could be improved.
Some of these, mostly the hardware changes, are described in section
\tref{sec:design-changes} of the appendix. During the first phase of the
project, a lot of time was spent researching solutions. In addition to this, the
hardware design required more time than expected.

All these, I believe, could be worth exploring in the future, and I hope that
this platform may serve a purpose beyond the scope of this semester project.
