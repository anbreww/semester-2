The project is divided into several stages.

The first stage involves getting familiar with the existing literature on the
subject of air bearings and film damping.

From here, it was possible to use some available analytical models, and through
some simplification, to evaluate which parameters will be important in the
design of the actuator and membrane, as well as estimate whether the desired
topology seems feasible or not given the environmental properties.
