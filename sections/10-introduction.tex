Currently, the game of air hockey is played with a puck and two

paddles.
Both the paddles and the puck are passive pieces of plastic. The game therefore
necessitates a heavy and expensive air table to generate a thin film of air,
which reduces the friction between the puck and the table.

The premise of this project is to design an actuator similar to an air hockey
puck, which can generate its own air film and thus function on any flat surface.
