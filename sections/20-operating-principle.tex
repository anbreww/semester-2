% TODO : explain principle

The self-levitating puck does not need an external air supply. Instead, it
creates its own air film by vibrating at a high frequency.

The puck is composed of four main elements:

% to follow explanation
\begin{enumerate}[A]
  \item The original puck, made of yellow ABS plastic. This is the base around
    which the system is built. The main idea of this project is to re-use a
    standard puck, according to USAA rules. With the addition of the other
    components, it will no longer be acceptable by official game rules though.
  \item The membrane, which is made of FR-4 (an epoxy mainly used in circuit
    board design). This membrane will resonate to create the pressure necessary
    to lift the contraption.
  \item An aluminium support ring will provide mechanical robustness to the
    device, as well as provide one fixed point for the membrane to move around.
  \item A piezo-electric actuator, in this case a ring stack, will actuate
    the membrane, exciting it at one of its resonant frequencies, in order to
    get the best possible vertical displacement.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Squeeze film}

The puck operates according to the principle of a squeeze film. In this
situation, an object can be lifted by a thin film of air, which is generated by
the object itself. The puck is considered to be stationary, and set at a certain
distance $h_0$ above the playing surface (the table). This distance is of the
order of \SI{10}{\micro\metre}.

The membrane is made to oscillate at a given frequency (typically around
\SIrange{20}{40}{\kilo\hertz}). Since the object has a certain inertia, it will
remain almost immobile compared to the membrane. Consequentially, the thickness
of the air film trapped between the membrane and the table will vary
periodically with the movement of the membrane. The air film thus gets
alternatively compressed and decompressed, creating forces that pull the puck
towards the table, then push it away. 

The pressure created by this back and forth movement is a non-linear function of
the airgap thickness. \Fig{fig:nonlinear-relationship} illustrates the
relationship between airgap $h$ and pressure $p$. In the case of air under
standard conditions, it behaves according to the following equation, with $n
\approx 1.4$

\begin{equation}
  pV^{n} \sim ph^{n} \approx const
  \label{eqn:pv-ph}
\end{equation}

In \FIG{fig:nonlinear-relationship}, the airgap is assumed to be varying
harmonically around a mean thickness $h_0$. Due to the non-linear relationship
between the airgap and the pressure, the mean pressure is actually slightly
higher than ambient pressure. In \cite{wiesendanger2001}, the airgap is given as

\begin{equation}
  h(t) = h_0 (1 - \varepsilon cos(\omega t)), \quad 0 \leq \varepsilon \leq 1
  \label{eqn:airgap-periodic}
\end{equation}

and therefore the medium pressure can be obtained by integrating the pressure
over one cycle:

\begin{equation}
  \bar{p} = 
  \frac{p_0 h_0}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\frac{1}{h(t)^n} \partial \omega t = 
  \frac{p_0}{\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}}
  \label{eqn:pmean}
\end{equation}

\Eq{eqn:pmean} gives us an approximation of the medium pressure under ideal
conditions (we have so far neglected boundary conditions). We can use this
result later to calculate how much relative variation we will need to provide
sufficient pressure to lift the puck. Here, $\varepsilon$ is the relative
displacement with regard to the mean airgap.

The previous calculations hold true if there is no airflow at the boudaries of
the system. However, in the system that will be studied in this project, air can
escape the system all around the membrane. 

Luckily, the flow of air is proportional to $h^3$, the third power of the
airgap, and the pressure gradient $\partial p / \partial x$. When the air is
being compressed, the pressure gradient will become larger, and tend to push air
out of the system. Since the airgap is elevated to the third power, at this
point $h$ is becoming smaller, and therefore $h^3$ is becoming very small.
Therefore, very little air escapes the system.

  \label{fig:boundary-airflow}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, when the membrane is getting farther away, the pressure is
lowering proportionally to the distance, whereas $h^3$ is increasing at a far
greater rate. As a result, the system will absorb more air during the
decompression cycle than during the compression cycle, and will always maintain
a sufficient amount of air to create an overpressure.

\Fig{fig:boundary-airflow} illustrates the various components that influence the
flow of air at the boundaries. The full description and demonstration can be
found in \cite{wiesendanger2001}.
