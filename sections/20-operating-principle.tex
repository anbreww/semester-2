% TODO : explain principle

The self-levitating puck does not need an external air supply. Instead, it
creates its own air film by vibrating at a high frequency.

The puck is composed of four main elements:

  \item[A] The original puck, made of yellow ABS plastic. This is the base
    around which the system is built. The main idea of this project is to re-use
    a standard puck, according to USAA rules. With the addition of the other
    components, it will no longer be acceptable by official game rules though.
  \item[B] The membrane is made of FR-4 (an epoxy mainly used in circuit board
    design). This membrane will resonate to create the pressure necessary to
    lift the contraption.
  \item[C] An aluminium support ring will provide mechanical robustness to the
    device, as well as provide one fixed point for the membrane to move around.
  \item[D] A piezo-electric actuator, in this case a ring stack, will actuate
    the membrane, exciting it at one of its resonant frequencies, in order to
    get the best possible vertical displacement.
