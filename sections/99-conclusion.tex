The hardware design is functional, and can be demonstrated as requested.
However, not everything is fully functional, and many areas could be improved.
Some of these, mostly the hardware changes, are described in section
project, a lot of time was spent researching solutions. In addition to this, the
hardware design required more time than expected.

All these, I believe, could be worth exploring in the future, and I hope that
this platform may serve a purpose beyond the scope of this semester project.
