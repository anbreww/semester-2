\section{Specifications}
\label{sec:specs}

The following page contains the system specifications as they were defined at
the beginning of the project. The design used in the final simulations adheres
to these specifications, with the exception of the total system height, which is
slightly higher than \SI{12}{\milli\metre}.

This is difficult to avoid when using a piezo stack, since the system is meant
to operate at low voltages. The design proposed by M. Wiesendanger
\cite{wiesendanger2001} would probably resolve this issue, as the membrane could
sit closer to the support.
